1
00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:08.117
How can we don't have the same
number of containers and lids?

2
00:00:08.118 --> 00:00:09.919
Why would they ever
get separated?

3
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.321
Built-up resentment,
money issues,

4
00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:14.223
Met a younger lid.

5
00:00:14.224 --> 00:00:15.491
Huh?
Mm-hmm.

6
00:00:15.492 --> 00:00:17.326
Mom, where's
my science homework?

7
00:00:17.327 --> 00:00:19.128
Uh, it's over there
on the table.

8
00:00:19.129 --> 00:00:21.130
So, alex, honey,
what's going on?

9
00:00:21.131 --> 00:00:22.381
Anything exciting?

10
00:00:22.382 --> 00:00:23.216
No.

11
00:00:23.217 --> 00:00:25.334
Any boys?
No.

12
00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:27.570
I'm feeling
a little bit disconnected

13
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:28.804
From alex right now.

14
00:00:28.805 --> 00:00:30.639
Last week,
I picked up her cellphone

15
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.974
Thinking it was mine,

16
00:00:31.975 --> 00:00:34.143
And I accidentally read
a few flirty text messages

17
00:00:34.144 --> 00:00:36.295
That were probably
from a boy in her class,

18
00:00:36.296 --> 00:00:37.413
Which is fine.

19
00:00:37.414 --> 00:00:39.581
Or they're from a drifter.

20
00:00:39.582 --> 00:00:41.067
Come on,
isn't there something

21
00:00:41.068 --> 00:00:42.852
You want to share
with your mommers?

22
00:00:42.853 --> 00:00:45.438
Yeah.
Don't call yourself "mommers."

23
00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:52.828
He blew his lid
when she tried to contain him.

24
00:01:12.382 --> 00:01:14.250
Okay.
What do you think?

25
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:16.018
I like it.
But you don't love it.

26
00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:17.319
No, I do. I love it.

27
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.388
As much as you loved the other one? Ooh.

28
00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:23.826
Okay.
Mm.

29
00:01:23.827 --> 00:01:26.862
The house is on fire. I only
have time to grab one shirt.

30
00:01:26.863 --> 00:01:28.230
Which one do I take?

31
00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:30.065
The correct answer
is take lily.

32
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.233
After that.

33
00:01:31.234 --> 00:01:32.501
Uh, okay,
the blue one.

34
00:01:32.502 --> 00:01:34.236
Because the gray one
washes me out.

35
00:01:34.237 --> 00:01:35.571
No, no. Cam, you -
you can't go wrong here.

36
00:01:35.572 --> 00:01:37.122
Everything you've tried on
looks great.

37
00:01:37.123 --> 00:01:38.424
I love you
in both of them.

38
00:01:38.425 --> 00:01:40.242
Oh, you're so nice
to me.

39
00:01:44.414 --> 00:01:49.118
Mihell has a problem with
public displays of affection.

40
00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.936
Um, I remember once
at a new year's eve party,

41
00:01:50.937 --> 00:01:54.123
Stroke of midnight,
he high-fived me.

42
00:01:54.124 --> 00:01:55.774
Two problems with that-

43
00:01:55.775 --> 00:01:58.060
One, gays don't high-five.

44
00:01:58.061 --> 00:02:01.230
O, gays don't high-five.

45
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:03.232
I'm home!

46
00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:05.868
Mmm,
what smells so good?

47
00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.337
<i>I'm making chunchullo,
a traditional colombian dish,</i>

48
00:02:08.338 --> 00:02:10.155
For dinner with the family
tonight.

49
00:02:10.156 --> 00:02:11.540
<i>Chunchullo.</i>

50
00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:13.309
What is that-
like, uh, tacos?

51
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.110
Yes, like tacos.

52
00:02:15.111 --> 00:02:16.312
No, it isn't.

53
00:02:16.313 --> 00:02:18.314
It's the small intestine
of a pig. Oh, geez.

54
00:02:18.315 --> 00:02:21.283
Why can't we eat regular food
like normal people?

55
00:02:21.284 --> 00:02:22.351
I told you, jay.

56
00:02:22.352 --> 00:02:24.620
My grandmother,
who rests in peace,

57
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:26.889
Has been coming to me
in my dreams,

58
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.475
Telling me that
I'm losing touch with my roots.

59
00:02:29.476 --> 00:02:30.893
See, this is awkward,

60
00:02:30.894 --> 00:02:33.395
Because my dead uncle joe
told me to have steak tonight.

61
00:02:33.396 --> 00:02:35.964
No, no, no, jay.
Haome respect.

62
00:02:35.965 --> 00:02:38.133
My grandmother
can hear you.

63
00:02:38.134 --> 00:02:40.603
What do you mean,
she can hear us?

64
00:02:40.604 --> 00:02:41.687
Well, in our culture,

65
00:02:41.688 --> 00:02:43.572
We believe that the dead
are all around us.

66
00:02:43.573 --> 00:02:44.490
She's right, manny.

67
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:45.991
She could be right here,

68
00:02:45.992 --> 00:02:48.777
Her bony fingers reaching out
from the grave.

69
00:02:50.313 --> 00:02:51.480
Yeah, keep it up, jay.

70
00:02:51.481 --> 00:02:53.315
There's already
one dead person in this room.

71
00:02:53.316 --> 00:02:55.034
You want to make it two?

72
00:02:55.035 --> 00:02:56.652
I'm sorry.
I've got a printer to install.

73
00:02:56.653 --> 00:02:58.337
Oh, gloria,
have your grandmother

74
00:02:58.338 --> 00:03:00.489
Run me up an iced tea
in about 10 minutes.

75
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.958
Yeah, she has a better chance
of making that work than you!

76
00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.210
Why don't you save us
the stomping and the swearing

77
00:03:05.211 --> 00:03:06.345
And call phil?

78
00:03:06.346 --> 00:03:07.429
He's good at that stuff.

79
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.497
Better than me?

80
00:03:08.498 --> 00:03:10.516
<i>Phil's not better than me
at anything,</i>

81
00:03:10.517 --> 00:03:13.452
Except maybe making that
stupid sound with his mouth.

82
00:03:18.925 --> 00:03:20.809
* a what, what *

83
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.611
You spit on me.

84
00:03:22.612 --> 00:03:26.098
Haley, honey, um, I need you
to do something for me.

85
00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.099
Ugh.
Mom, my arm hurts.

86
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.501
Why don't you find out
what it is

87
00:03:29.502 --> 00:03:31.437
Before you start making up
excuses to get out of it?

88
00:03:31.438 --> 00:03:33.172
okay, what is it?

89
00:03:33.173 --> 00:03:34.840
I need you
to talk to your sister.

90
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:38.043
I think that there's something
going on with her and a boy.

91
00:03:38.044 --> 00:03:39.511
So?

92
00:03:39.512 --> 00:03:41.647
<i>So, I am your mother,
and it is my job to make sure</i>

93
00:03:41.648 --> 00:03:43.882
That you girls don't
get involved with a predator.

94
00:03:43.883 --> 00:03:45.684
Okay, mom,
stop watching "dateline."

95
00:03:45.685 --> 00:03:47.402
<i>And why can't you
just talk to her?</i>

96
00:03:47.403 --> 00:03:49.388
<i>I have tried
to talk to her.</i>

97
00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.990
I- she won't talk to me.
You know that.

98
00:03:51.991 --> 00:03:54.827
That's because you get so weird
every time a boy comes near us.

99
00:03:54.828 --> 00:03:56.795
I- I just don't want
you girls to-

100
00:03:56.796 --> 00:03:59.131
To make the same
mistakes that you did? No!

101
00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:01.166
No.

102
00:04:01.167 --> 00:04:02.551
Mom, I'm not an idiot.

103
00:04:02.552 --> 00:04:03.836
I pick up on things.

104
00:04:03.837 --> 00:04:05.670
And I don't think
that you were the good girl

105
00:04:05.671 --> 00:04:06.772
You pretend you were.

106
00:04:06.773 --> 00:04:08.991
Wow.
That is so untrue.

107
00:04:08.992 --> 00:04:11.243
<i>I was a very good girl.
Mm.</i>

108
00:04:11.244 --> 00:04:14.279
Your kids don't need to know
who you were before you had them.

109
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.064
They need to know
who you wish you were,

110
00:04:16.065 --> 00:04:18.650
<i>And they need to try
to live up to that person.</i>

111
00:04:18.651 --> 00:04:19.951
They're gonna fall short,

112
00:04:19.952 --> 00:04:22.153
<i>But better they fall short
of the fake you</i>

113
00:04:22.154 --> 00:04:23.355
<i>Than the real you.</i>

114
00:04:23.356 --> 00:04:24.856
Which is why
we don't hide anything.

115
00:04:24.857 --> 00:04:26.491
<i>That's the opposite
of what I just said.</i>

116
00:04:26.492 --> 00:04:29.261
I was not listening.

117
00:04:30.446 --> 00:04:31.580
Ohh.

118
00:04:31.581 --> 00:04:33.582
I'll say it again-
I love you in paisley.

119
00:04:33.583 --> 00:04:35.366
Oh, let me lock the door
and draw the curtains.

120
00:04:35.367 --> 00:04:36.701
What does that mean?

121
00:04:36.702 --> 00:04:38.837
It doesn't mean anything.
Good.

122
00:04:38.838 --> 00:04:40.071
You know
exactly what it means.

123
00:04:40.072 --> 00:04:41.640
You won't kiss me
in front of other people

124
00:04:41.641 --> 00:04:43.108
Because you're ashamed
of who you are.

125
00:04:43.109 --> 00:04:45.343
And, yes...I went there.

126
00:04:45.344 --> 00:04:47.078
Okay, you can't say,
"yes, I went there,"

127
00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:48.530
When you go there
all the time.

128
00:04:48.531 --> 00:04:51.116
And, by the way, I'm the one
who makes speeches on airplanes

129
00:04:51.117 --> 00:04:52.784
Every time someone
looks at us weird.

130
00:04:52.785 --> 00:04:54.452
I'm the one
who gives my dad hell

131
00:04:54.453 --> 00:04:56.371
When he refers to you
as my "friend."

132
00:04:56.372 --> 00:04:58.356
That's different.
That's confrontation.

133
00:04:58.357 --> 00:04:59.808
But you know
what takes real strength?

134
00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:00.959
Whining?

135
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.928
Affection. Oh, this is insane.

136
00:05:02.929 --> 00:05:05.063
Buying a shirt-
it's not a kiss-worthy moment.

137
00:05:05.064 --> 00:05:06.815
Oh, I didn't know
there was an official list.

138
00:05:06.816 --> 00:05:08.300
Please, tell us-
what is on the list?

139
00:05:08.301 --> 00:05:09.901
<i>I'll tell you
what's not on the list-</i>

140
00:05:09.902 --> 00:05:11.736
Finding
jalapeño-stuffed olives,

141
00:05:11.737 --> 00:05:13.121
Making the light on maple,

142
00:05:13.122 --> 00:05:14.539
Every time
we see a v.W.

143
00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.941
You don't
like "kiss-buggy"?

144
00:05:15.942 --> 00:05:17.209
It's not a real game!

145
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.344
It- it's just another way
for you to be needy.

146
00:05:19.345 --> 00:05:21.546
I- and I don't appreciate
you making me feel bad

147
00:05:21.547 --> 00:05:23.849
Because I can't live up
to your impossible standards.

148
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.517
Nobody kisses
at a bowling alley!

149
00:05:25.518 --> 00:05:27.936
I almost got a turkey!

150
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:40.549
"yello"?

151
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.601
Oh, hey, jay. Just a sec.
I'll go get claire.

152
00:05:42.602 --> 00:05:43.902
Oh, actually,
it's you I'm calling.

153
00:05:44.704 --> 00:05:45.854
What was that?

154
00:05:45.855 --> 00:05:48.006
The cat. There's a cat.
What's up?

155
00:05:48.007 --> 00:05:49.807
Well, gloria's been missing
her grandmother.

156
00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:52.143
I've been trying to get
this old picture of her printed,

157
00:05:52.144 --> 00:05:53.811
But I can't get
this new printer to-

158
00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:55.080
I'll be right there.

159
00:05:55.081 --> 00:05:56.948
Luke, grandpa needs us!

160
00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:58.850
Hells yes,
I was glad to get the call.

161
00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:00.752
Jay's always around here
fixing things,

162
00:06:00.753 --> 00:06:02.721
Cracking jokes
about my "delicate hands"

163
00:06:02.722 --> 00:06:06.091
Or my gag response
to the smell of paint.

164
00:06:06.092 --> 00:06:07.659
Look who needs me now-

165
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.528
Mr. Hot-dog fingers
who can't press "print"

166
00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:13.164
Without hitting
three extra keys.

167
00:06:13.165 --> 00:06:14.499
Yeah!

168
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.836
You're in my house now, jay!

169
00:06:17.837 --> 00:06:20.238
T- technically,
we'll be in his house,

170
00:06:20.239 --> 00:06:21.873
But we'll be in my area...

171
00:06:21.874 --> 00:06:23.258
Of his house.

172
00:06:25.354 --> 00:06:27.205
So, I hear
you have a boyfriend.

173
00:06:27.206 --> 00:06:28.672
No, I don't.
Who is he?

174
00:06:28.673 --> 00:06:30.692
I'm not talking to you
about this. Oh, come on.

175
00:06:30.693 --> 00:06:33.111
You're finally interesting.
Just tell me.

176
00:06:33.112 --> 00:06:34.445
<i>He's not my boyfriend.</i>

177
00:06:34.446 --> 00:06:35.663
It's jeremy reed.

178
00:06:35.664 --> 00:06:38.249
It's- he's just this boy
that I-

179
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.667
Love?
No!

180
00:06:39.668 --> 00:06:40.852
Well, have you guys
kissed yet?

181
00:06:40.853 --> 00:06:41.803
No!

182
00:06:41.804 --> 00:06:43.805
Well, what are you
waiting for?

183
00:06:43.806 --> 00:06:45.456
I'm not waiting.
I'm 13.

184
00:06:45.457 --> 00:06:47.291
<i>And you've never
kiss boy?</i>

185
00:06:47.292 --> 00:06:48.393
How old were you?

186
00:06:48.394 --> 00:06:49.327
Like 11.

187
00:06:49.328 --> 00:06:51.262
And it was beautiful.

188
00:06:51.263 --> 00:06:54.699
I was in jackson kaner's
carpeted garage.

189
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.401
11?
Yeah.

190
00:06:56.402 --> 00:06:57.502
So you better get on it,

191
00:06:57.503 --> 00:06:58.953
Or else he's gonna think
you're a lesbian.

192
00:06:58.954 --> 00:07:00.505
He's not going to think
I'm a lesbian.

193
00:07:00.506 --> 00:07:02.006
<i>I thought you were.</i>

194
00:07:02.007 --> 00:07:04.709
You totally have the sandals
for it.

195
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.612
Let's see this bad boy.

196
00:07:07.613 --> 00:07:10.515
Oh, a p-750.
Nice unit.

197
00:07:10.516 --> 00:07:12.116
I would have sprung
for the 840,

198
00:07:12.117 --> 00:07:13.317
But I get it-

199
00:07:13.318 --> 00:07:15.119
Not everyone can handle
that kind of horsepower.

200
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.154
I thought maybe the cordless
phone was interfering,

201
00:07:17.155 --> 00:07:18.289
So I unplugged it.

202
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.007
Good idea.
Maybe we should run downstairs

203
00:07:20.008 --> 00:07:21.759
And unplug the toaster
while we're at it.

204
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.161
oh, snap, dad.

205
00:07:24.162 --> 00:07:25.096
Toaster.

206
00:07:25.097 --> 00:07:26.297
We're kidding.

207
00:07:26.298 --> 00:07:28.633
A cordless phone
is 5.8 gigahertz. This is wi-fi.

208
00:07:28.634 --> 00:07:30.601
It's a totally different
spectrum.

209
00:07:30.602 --> 00:07:32.470
Walk with me?

210
00:07:32.471 --> 00:07:36.140
Here's a little trick that I've
found pretty useful with claire.

211
00:07:37.609 --> 00:07:41.412
* the computer and the printer
must talk, talk, talk *

212
00:07:41.413 --> 00:07:45.816
* "command-p" makes the picture
walk, walk, walk *

213
00:07:47.953 --> 00:07:50.021
How come
it's not working?

214
00:07:50.022 --> 00:07:51.038
It should be.

215
00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:51.989
Okay.

216
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.542
Uh,
that should be printing.

217
00:07:54.543 --> 00:07:55.660
So...

218
00:07:55.661 --> 00:07:58.212
Hey, phil,
I'm gonna get a beer, beer, beer

219
00:07:58.213 --> 00:08:00.464
Before I hit you
in the head, head, head.

220
00:08:07.422 --> 00:08:09.423
Hey.
What are you doing here?

221
00:08:09.424 --> 00:08:11.592
Hi, jeremy.
I want to ask you something.

222
00:08:11.593 --> 00:08:14.495
Sure, ask-
waitdon't talk yet.

223
00:08:14.496 --> 00:08:16.831
We've texting for a while,
and it's been nice,

224
00:08:16.832 --> 00:08:19.166
But I feel like it's leading
to something else,

225
00:08:19.167 --> 00:08:20.968
And I don't know
if you do or not,

226
00:08:20.969 --> 00:08:22.937
But I guess what
I'm trying to say is,

227
00:08:22.938 --> 00:08:25.857
I'm just a girl
standing in front of a boy

228
00:08:25.858 --> 00:08:27.909
Asking for him
to like her.

229
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.278
Oh, god,
that's from "notting hill."

230
00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:32.846
So dorky. But a really
underrated movie.

231
00:08:32.847 --> 00:08:34.315
What's happening?

232
00:08:34.316 --> 00:08:35.516
I'm not a lesbian.

233
00:08:35.517 --> 00:08:37.652
I would like
for you to kiss me.

234
00:08:54.471 --> 00:08:56.522
Oh, I love
watching you stir.

235
00:08:56.523 --> 00:08:57.773
Then I will stop.

236
00:08:57.774 --> 00:08:59.992
What?
Are you still mad at me?

237
00:08:59.993 --> 00:09:03.128
Yes. You have to apologize
for making fun of my culture,

238
00:09:03.129 --> 00:09:05.848
<i>My beliefs, my chunchullo,
my abuela.</i>

239
00:09:05.849 --> 00:09:07.032
I'm sorry.

240
00:09:07.033 --> 00:09:09.435
If you think your grandmother's
here with us,

241
00:09:09.436 --> 00:09:10.469
I respect that.

242
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:11.970
Now, come here.

243
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:13.906
Oh, grandma!
Where'd you come from?

244
00:09:13.907 --> 00:09:16.608
We're gonna have to get you
a little bell.

245
00:09:17.744 --> 00:09:18.710
Enough, jay!

246
00:09:18.711 --> 00:09:20.946
My culture
is very important to me!

247
00:09:20.947 --> 00:09:22.848
I've been working all day
to share it

248
00:09:22.849 --> 00:09:25.350
With your family tonight,
and all you do is mock me!

249
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:26.435
Just go!

250
00:09:26.436 --> 00:09:27.752
Honey, I'm sorry.

251
00:09:27.753 --> 00:09:29.221
I'm just teasing you.

252
00:09:29.222 --> 00:09:31.690
Instead of being the comedian,
why don't you help me?

253
00:09:31.691 --> 00:09:33.058
What do you need?

254
00:09:34.861 --> 00:09:36.161
Slap the chicken.

255
00:09:36.162 --> 00:09:37.830
Do what?

256
00:09:37.831 --> 00:09:40.532
In colombia, when you cook
in honor of the departed,

257
00:09:40.533 --> 00:09:43.502
You have to scare death
away from the food

258
00:09:43.503 --> 00:09:45.504
To protect the people
that are gonna eat it.

259
00:09:45.505 --> 00:09:47.339
Slap it and yell.

260
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.891
That's the nuttiest-

261
00:09:48.892 --> 00:09:50.342
Jay!
Calm down.

262
00:09:50.343 --> 00:09:52.227
Give me the chicken.

263
00:09:52.228 --> 00:09:53.312
Here we go.

264
00:09:53.313 --> 00:09:55.898
Mm-hmm.

265
00:09:55.899 --> 00:09:58.500
That's not
scaring anything away.

266
00:09:58.501 --> 00:10:00.169
When my grather
used to cook,

267
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.655
The whole house
would she.

268
00:10:03.656 --> 00:10:05.674
Aah! Aah! Aah!

269
00:10:05.675 --> 00:10:07.626
Louder.
Aah!

270
00:10:08.828 --> 00:10:10.128
Higher.

271
00:10:11.464 --> 00:10:13.131
Louder!

272
00:10:13.132 --> 00:10:16.251
Higher! Louder! There!

273
00:10:16.252 --> 00:10:17.402
I made all that up.

274
00:10:17.403 --> 00:10:19.638
That is not a real custom
in colombia.

275
00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:21.039
We're not lunatics.

276
00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.775
But you mess with us,
and we mess with you.

277
00:10:23.776 --> 00:10:25.928
<i>That's the custom.</i>

278
00:10:28.314 --> 00:10:30.282
Louder!

279
00:10:32.885 --> 00:10:34.219
Hey, honey.
Where'd you go?

280
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.754
Nowhere.
Just for a bike ride.

281
00:10:35.755 --> 00:10:38.106
Oh, my god! Puh-lease tell me
this text is wrong!

282
00:10:38.107 --> 00:10:40.342
Did you really just
go over to that kid's house

283
00:10:40.343 --> 00:10:42.694
And try and kiss him
in front of a million people?!

284
00:10:42.695 --> 00:10:44.663
Alex, did you do that?
You got a text?

285
00:10:44.664 --> 00:10:46.414
<i>Oh, yeah.
Everybody knows.</i>

286
00:10:46.415 --> 00:10:48.983
<i>Do you know how embarrassing
this is for me?!</i>

287
00:10:48.984 --> 00:10:50.051
This is all your fault!

288
00:10:50.052 --> 00:10:51.886
You're the one
who said I had to kiss him

289
00:10:51.887 --> 00:10:53.054
Or I was a lesbian!

290
00:10:53.055 --> 00:10:54.956
Haley!
Did you say that to her?!

291
00:10:54.957 --> 00:10:56.725
Oh, don't turn this on me.
Look at her shoes!

292
00:10:56.726 --> 00:10:58.476
Ugh! I'm never
going back to school now.

293
00:10:58.477 --> 00:11:00.762
No, sweetheart. Yes, you are.
You are going back to school.

294
00:11:00.763 --> 00:11:01.896
But listen to me-

295
00:11:01.897 --> 00:11:03.631
Just because a boy
sends you flirty texts

296
00:11:03.632 --> 00:11:05.684
Doesn't mean that you have to text
him back- what?! You read my texts?!

297
00:11:05.685 --> 00:11:07.652
I...
You read her texts?!

298
00:11:07.653 --> 00:11:09.937
<i>That's why you made me
talk to her?!</i>

299
00:11:09.938 --> 00:11:11.439
You made her talk to me?!

300
00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.042
I kind of feel like we're
spinning out here a little bit.

301
00:11:14.043 --> 00:11:16.044
Look, alex,
the important thing here

302
00:11:16.045 --> 00:11:18.480
Is that you have to be very
careful how you behave around boys

303
00:11:18.481 --> 00:11:21.383
Because it is so easy
to get a reputation.

304
00:11:21.384 --> 00:11:23.985
Well, I'm sorry I'm not a perfect
little good girl like you were!

305
00:11:25.821 --> 00:11:27.989
Were you?
Ohh.

306
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.158
Were you?!

307
00:11:30.159 --> 00:11:32.660
I highly doubt it!

308
00:11:32.661 --> 00:11:36.464
Don't be such a chicken.
There's no ghost in here.

309
00:11:36.465 --> 00:11:38.199
I'm telling you,
my mom said

310
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.402
Her dead grander
was in the house.

311
00:11:40.403 --> 00:11:42.604
She said she felt her here
this morning...

312
00:11:42.605 --> 00:11:43.772
In this room.

313
00:11:43.773 --> 00:11:45.840
Maybe your mom's
mentally ill.

314
00:11:52.665 --> 00:11:55.083
who puts a router...

315
00:11:55.084 --> 00:11:57.052
In the attic?

316
00:11:58.921 --> 00:12:01.923
Did she have a limp
and a cane?

317
00:12:01.924 --> 00:12:03.224
Uh-huh.

318
00:12:11.367 --> 00:12:14.402
Ghost of manny's
great-grandma,

319
00:12:14.403 --> 00:12:17.305
If that's really you,

320
00:12:17.306 --> 00:12:19.340
Show yourself!

321
00:12:24.597 --> 00:12:25.930
That's her!

322
00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:27.231
Aah!

323
00:12:32.238 --> 00:12:35.156
Come on!

324
00:12:35.157 --> 00:12:37.225
Why?!

325
00:12:37.226 --> 00:12:39.027
Why?!

326
00:12:43.215 --> 00:12:45.266
Hi, grandpa.
How we doing, girls?

327
00:12:45.267 --> 00:12:46.768
Mom ruined my life today.

328
00:12:46.769 --> 00:12:48.820
I didn't ruin your life. I
was- don't even talk to me!

329
00:12:48.821 --> 00:12:50.154
I didn't even
want to come here.

330
00:12:50.155 --> 00:12:52.106
Well, okay.

331
00:12:52.107 --> 00:12:54.158
Snacks and and sodas
are in the living room,

332
00:12:54.159 --> 00:12:56.327
But don't fill up-
we've got intestines coming.

333
00:12:56.328 --> 00:12:58.696
Uh, dad, if you're looking
for your shoes,

334
00:12:58.697 --> 00:13:00.531
I think I know
where they are.

335
00:13:00.532 --> 00:13:02.500
This happens to be
a colombian custom-

336
00:13:02.501 --> 00:13:05.269
Walking in the footsteps of
the ancestors, blah, blah, blah.

337
00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.570
Beats slapping the chicken.

338
00:13:09.775 --> 00:13:11.342
Here,
I brought you a drink.

339
00:13:11.343 --> 00:13:12.409
Oh, wait a minute-

340
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:14.445
Sip it first.

341
00:13:14.446 --> 00:13:16.964
I'm not mad at you.

342
00:13:16.965 --> 00:13:18.983
I thought about it,
and maybe you're right.

343
00:13:18.984 --> 00:13:20.601
I can be
a little needy sometimes.

344
00:13:20.602 --> 00:13:22.587
Oh, well,
I- I appreciate that.

345
00:13:22.588 --> 00:13:25.056
And you're probably
not entirely off base.

346
00:13:25.057 --> 00:13:27.859
I mean, lord knows
I- I've got my quirks.

347
00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.528
And I-I'm not e most
demonstrative guy around,

348
00:13:30.529 --> 00:13:33.931
But I'm-
I'm woing on it.

349
00:13:33.932 --> 00:13:35.700
And I'm gonna help you with it. Good.

350
00:13:35.701 --> 00:13:37.768
Just don't give up on me.

351
00:13:37.769 --> 00:13:39.069
Never.

352
00:13:39.771 --> 00:13:41.489
Okay, everybody,
let's gather around!

353
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:42.940
Jay, come here.

354
00:13:42.941 --> 00:13:46.777
Tonight we dine on the
traditional colombian recipes

355
00:13:46.778 --> 00:13:49.146
<i>Of my abuela,
my grandmother.</i>

356
00:13:49.147 --> 00:13:51.749
And even though
she's no longer with me,

357
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.552
I am very happy
because I have all of you.

358
00:13:54.553 --> 00:13:58.956
To ana-maria rosa de la
immaculada jimenez morales.

359
00:13:58.957 --> 00:14:01.976
To ana-maria rosa...

360
00:14:03.562 --> 00:14:06.630
That was beautiful, gloria,
just like my mitchell.

361
00:14:06.631 --> 00:14:07.565
Oh, oh! Whoa!

362
00:14:07.566 --> 00:14:08.465
Aah!

363
00:14:08.466 --> 00:14:09.400
Oh!

364
00:14:09.401 --> 00:14:12.837
Just slipped
right off there.

365
00:14:13.954 --> 00:14:16.489
Ay, cameron,
what happened?

366
00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.025
One moment you were there,
the next, only shoes.

367
00:14:19.026 --> 00:14:20.460
I'll tell you
what happened-

368
00:14:20.461 --> 00:14:22.378
Mitchell is embarrassed to kiss
me in front of other people.

369
00:14:22.379 --> 00:14:23.729
No, you ambushed me!

370
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.331
Oh, cam, come on.
Don't take it personally.

371
00:14:25.332 --> 00:14:26.616
When mitchell
was in high school,

372
00:14:26.617 --> 00:14:28.168
He was dating this girl-
robin schier.

373
00:14:28.169 --> 00:14:29.385
He would never kiss her,
either.

374
00:14:29.386 --> 00:14:32.472
That's because I was gay.

375
00:14:32.473 --> 00:14:34.173
What's your excuse now?

376
00:14:34.174 --> 00:14:36.693
Ay, cameron,
it's not mitch's fault.

377
00:14:36.694 --> 00:14:38.411
He gets it
from his father.

378
00:14:38.412 --> 00:14:41.748
Jay doesn't like the lovey-dovey
in public, either.

379
00:14:41.749 --> 00:14:43.850
I can't believe
you're coming at me right now.

380
00:14:43.851 --> 00:14:45.852
I'm standing here with shoes
around my neck,

381
00:14:45.853 --> 00:14:47.720
And for the better part
of a half-hour,

382
00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:49.522
I screamed the death
out of your meat.

383
00:14:49.523 --> 00:14:51.825
Now, what do you want
from me? Don't you see?

384
00:14:51.826 --> 00:14:55.762
<i>It's because of you that your
son cannot kiss his own lover.</i>

385
00:14:55.763 --> 00:14:58.631
Don't say "lover."
we don't like "lover."

386
00:14:58.632 --> 00:15:00.700
Can we just eat?

387
00:15:00.701 --> 00:15:04.937
No. Tell mitch that it's okay
to kiss cam in front of you.

388
00:15:04.938 --> 00:15:06.873
<i>Why is that something
we have to do?</i>

389
00:15:06.874 --> 00:15:08.875
We don't.
Of course we don't.

390
00:15:08.876 --> 00:15:11.027
Oh, I'm sorry that I don't
want to make out with you

391
00:15:11.028 --> 00:15:12.311
In front
of my whole family.

392
00:15:12.312 --> 00:15:13.846
No need to apologize.

393
00:15:13.847 --> 00:15:15.348
Oh, gloria is right.

394
00:15:15.349 --> 00:15:17.400
Dad, you being
so emotionally closed off

395
00:15:17.401 --> 00:15:20.386
Makes it very difficult for
your children to show affection.

396
00:15:20.387 --> 00:15:22.622
Really?
Yes.

397
00:15:22.623 --> 00:15:24.690
You had trouble showing
affection in public places?

398
00:15:24.691 --> 00:15:25.658
Yes!

399
00:15:25.659 --> 00:15:27.193
You?
Yes.

400
00:15:27.194 --> 00:15:28.427
Was that before or after

401
00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:30.263
You were delivered to my door
in a squad car,

402
00:15:30.264 --> 00:15:32.064
Wearing nothing but your
underwear and a police blanket?

403
00:15:32.065 --> 00:15:34.767
Oh, my god. What?
You were arrested?

404
00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:36.602
Awesome!
Not awesome.

405
00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:38.337
And I wasn't
arrested.

406
00:15:38.338 --> 00:15:40.556
Your grandfather
was just telling a joke.

407
00:15:40.557 --> 00:15:42.391
It was just a joke.
I got a million of 'em.

408
00:15:42.392 --> 00:15:43.342
Dad.

409
00:15:43.343 --> 00:15:44.677
I did it!
It's printing!

410
00:15:44.678 --> 00:15:47.346
I had to download new firmware,
install new drivers,

411
00:15:47.347 --> 00:15:50.149
Change your encryption,
and replace an ethernet cable

412
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:51.367
In a 100-degree attic,

413
00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:54.420
While dodging
particularly aggressive spiders,

414
00:15:54.421 --> 00:15:56.322
But I did it!

415
00:15:56.323 --> 00:15:57.590
Thanks.

416
00:15:57.591 --> 00:16:00.526
Oh. Okay.
I guess that's it.

417
00:16:00.527 --> 00:16:01.777
What? What's it?

418
00:16:01.778 --> 00:16:03.012
Wake up, dummy.

419
00:16:03.013 --> 00:16:05.614
This is what
we're talking about.

420
00:16:05.615 --> 00:16:08.951
This guy's been working like
an imbecile all day for you.

421
00:16:08.952 --> 00:16:11.821
People need something else-
kisses, hugs.

422
00:16:11.822 --> 00:16:13.722
What,
for fixing a printer?

423
00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:15.858
Oh, it's fine.
It was only four hours.

424
00:16:15.859 --> 00:16:18.194
I tipped over a paint can
and threw up a little,

425
00:16:18.195 --> 00:16:20.529
But I think- I think "thanks"
about covers it.

426
00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:21.964
Well, what's wrong
with "thanks"?

427
00:16:21.965 --> 00:16:23.399
It's pretty much
the bare minimum, dad.

428
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:27.002
<i>Jay, for god's sakes,
just say something.</i>

429
00:16:27.003 --> 00:16:28.838
You want me
to say something?

430
00:16:28.839 --> 00:16:30.306
How about
"you're welcome"?

431
00:16:30.307 --> 00:16:32.992
How about "I'm- I'm so happy
to be here for you all

432
00:16:32.993 --> 00:16:35.544
So I can take the blame
for all your crap."

433
00:16:35.545 --> 00:16:37.463
I don't do this,
I never did that.

434
00:16:37.464 --> 00:16:41.050
Trust me, I gave you twice as
much as my father ever gave me.

435
00:16:41.051 --> 00:16:43.686
The man kissed me
one time in my entire life.

436
00:16:43.687 --> 00:16:45.754
He came up behind me, kissed me
on the back of the head,

437
00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.122
Said, "goodnight, becky."

438
00:16:47.123 --> 00:16:48.357
He thought
I was my sister.

439
00:16:48.358 --> 00:16:49.492
Wait a minute.

440
00:16:49.493 --> 00:16:52.728
When was the last time
you kissed mitch?

441
00:16:52.729 --> 00:16:54.129
What does that
have to do with anything?

442
00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:56.365
Mitch, when was the last time
he kissed you?

443
00:16:56.366 --> 00:16:57.532
I- I don't remember.

444
00:16:57.533 --> 00:16:59.468
It wasn't that long ago. I was 12.

445
00:16:59.469 --> 00:17:01.837
12?
This is the problem!

446
00:17:01.838 --> 00:17:04.006
Jay's dad doesn't kiss jay,

447
00:17:04.007 --> 00:17:07.826
So jay doe't kiss mitch,
and mitch is uptight.

448
00:17:07.827 --> 00:17:09.995
Okay, okay, "uptight"
was really not on the table.

449
00:17:09.996 --> 00:17:11.280
This is more about
kissing.

450
00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:13.849
Jay, kiss your son.
He's a mess.

451
00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:15.634
Oh, come on, now.

452
00:17:15.635 --> 00:17:16.952
We don't have to do that.
It's...

453
00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:17.886
Yes, you do.
No.

454
00:17:17.887 --> 00:17:19.287
Come on.

455
00:17:19.288 --> 00:17:21.590
Come on, do it. You're in front
of your grandchildren.

456
00:17:23.426 --> 00:17:27.279
All right, all right!
Shut up!

457
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.897
Mitch,
get over here.

458
00:17:28.898 --> 00:17:30.766
W- what, now?
Well, I feel weird now.

459
00:17:30.767 --> 00:17:32.233
Don't be coy.

460
00:17:32.234 --> 00:17:34.202
What are you waiting for, a box
of chocolates? Let's do this.

461
00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:45.681
Ohh.

462
00:17:45.682 --> 00:17:47.849
That's the sweetest
thing I've ever seen.

463
00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:51.119
All right, and now because I
never want to hear this again-

464
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.154
You.

465
00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:53.188
Ohh.

466
00:17:53.189 --> 00:17:54.206
Not you.

467
00:17:54.207 --> 00:17:56.208
Oh, daddy, I love you.

468
00:17:57.961 --> 00:17:59.695
Let's go eat chunchullo!

469
00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:04.049
You know it's made of
pig intestines, right?

470
00:18:09.989 --> 00:18:11.139
Alex, wait.

471
00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.650
What?
I want to talk to you.

472
00:18:12.651 --> 00:18:14.486
Mom, I don't want
another lecture.

473
00:18:14.487 --> 00:18:17.021
It's not a lecture.
I want to tell you something.

474
00:18:17.022 --> 00:18:20.358
Honey, I know
exactly how you're feeling.

475
00:18:20.359 --> 00:18:22.293
No, you don't.

476
00:18:22.294 --> 00:18:26.765
Okay, the- the joke
that grandpa told tonight?

477
00:18:26.766 --> 00:18:29.033
That- that happened.

478
00:18:29.034 --> 00:18:31.302
That...That was true.

479
00:18:31.303 --> 00:18:32.904
<i>So, you were
arrested naked?</i>

480
00:18:32.905 --> 00:18:33.971
I wasn't naked!

481
00:18:33.972 --> 00:18:36.674
And I was not arrested
per se.

482
00:18:36.675 --> 00:18:40.378
I was driven home one night
by the police

483
00:18:40.379 --> 00:18:42.180
Because my boyfriend and I

484
00:18:42.181 --> 00:18:44.799
Had gone swimming
in somebody's pool,

485
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.986
And we didn't have bathing suits
and- blah, blah, blah.

486
00:18:47.987 --> 00:18:49.721
The details
aren't important.

487
00:18:49.722 --> 00:18:53.191
What matters is that everybody
at school was talking about it.

488
00:18:53.192 --> 00:18:54.592
And I thought I would die.

489
00:18:54.593 --> 00:18:57.162
But it passed.

490
00:18:57.163 --> 00:18:59.063
I swear.

491
00:18:59.064 --> 00:19:02.167
And now, honey, I'm-
I'm glad it happened.

492
00:19:02.168 --> 00:19:04.669
I've got a funny story
to tell at dinner parties.

493
00:19:05.971 --> 00:19:09.557
So, how long did it take
before you thought it was funny?

494
00:19:09.558 --> 00:19:11.743
Oh, god...

495
00:19:11.744 --> 00:19:14.295
10, 15 years.

496
00:19:14.296 --> 00:19:16.564
Great.
What do I do about tomorrow?

497
00:19:16.565 --> 00:19:18.983
I don't think
you have to worry about that.

498
00:19:24.957 --> 00:19:26.991
Go, go, go.

499
00:19:26.992 --> 00:19:29.694
In colombia,
we kiss for everything

500
00:19:29.695 --> 00:19:32.864
Because a kiss can mean
so many different things.

501
00:19:32.865 --> 00:19:34.665
There's no ghost in here,
is there?

502
00:19:34.666 --> 00:19:36.667
Not a chance.

503
00:19:36.668 --> 00:19:38.502
Sleep easy, kid.

504
00:19:40.889 --> 00:19:43.691
It can be the start
of something new.

505
00:19:50.416 --> 00:19:53.785
It can be how we say, "this
is the person that I love."

506
00:19:53.786 --> 00:19:55.653
So who's a better kisser,
me or your dad?

507
00:19:55.654 --> 00:19:57.488
Ew.

508
00:19:57.489 --> 00:19:59.557
It can be romantic.

509
00:19:59.558 --> 00:20:02.660
Just so you know,
if my friends weren't there,

510
00:20:02.661 --> 00:20:04.045
I would've said yes.

511
00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.465
So,
if you still want to...

512
00:20:09.534 --> 00:20:11.368
If it's okay...

513
00:20:11.369 --> 00:20:13.504
Maybe we should
hang out more first.

514
00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:16.040
This is only the second
conversation we've had

515
00:20:16.041 --> 00:20:17.175
That wasn't by text.

516
00:20:17.176 --> 00:20:18.476
Whew!

517
00:20:18.477 --> 00:20:20.895
It can also
be worth waiting for.

518
00:20:20.896 --> 00:20:24.682
Jay, what is this?

519
00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:26.317
Just another nice thing
I did for you

520
00:20:26.318 --> 00:20:27.652
While you
made a fool of me.

521
00:20:27.653 --> 00:20:30.071
Manny let me in
on your little tricks.

522
00:20:30.072 --> 00:20:31.823
You feel bad now?

523
00:20:31.824 --> 00:20:33.324
No. I feel good.

524
00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:37.828
Mm.

525
00:20:40.666 --> 00:20:44.023
That one
is definitely my favorite.

526
00:20:46.457 --> 00:20:47.809
Phil, you really
don't have to do this.

527
00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:51.246
No. I-I can do it.
I want to do it.

528
00:20:51.247 --> 00:20:54.629
It's silly to pay someone
else just to do something-

529
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:55.714
Oh!

530
00:20:55.715 --> 00:20:57.482
Oh, no! Oh!

531
00:20:57.483 --> 00:20:58.733
Oh, wait!
No, no, don't spill it!

532
00:20:58.734 --> 00:20:59.884
Sweetie, don't spill that!
Oh!

533
00:20:59.885 --> 00:21:01.636
Oh, that's on me!
Careful! Oh, gosh!

534
00:21:01.637 --> 00:21:03.421
Oh! Okay, get up. You're fine.

535
00:21:03.422 --> 00:21:05.323
Get it off! Okay, I got it. I got it.

536
00:21:05.324 --> 00:21:06.474
Got it off. Got it off.

537
00:21:06.475 --> 00:21:07.726
Oh, the face!
Not the face!

538
00:21:07.727 --> 00:21:09.060
Oh, the face! All
right, I'll pull it down!

539
00:21:09.061 --> 00:21:10.528
Ohh!
You're good!

540
00:21:10.529 --> 00:21:12.697
It's on me. All right, I'm
gonna have to- I'll cut it off.

541
00:21:12.698 --> 00:21:13.998
Good idea.

542
00:21:15.568 --> 00:21:16.918
Get a bucket, please!
